Cinnamon Licorice powder
this stuff is a poor example of an authentic 5-spice powder which I paid $1.5 for 4oz locally, despite the fact that other Dynasty products are useful such as their Satay sauce.
I live walking distance to Flushing Queens, and have a good idea what it's supposed to taste like from authentic Asian cooking sold nearby.
If you want to go cheap off Amazon, you are better off withFrontier Five Spice Powder, 1.92-Ounce Bottle.
BTW "star anise" or "aniseed" is already a licorice flavor, so to add even more licorice to this bottle was foolish.

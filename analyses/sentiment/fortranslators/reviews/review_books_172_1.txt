Kindle Sample
I adore this book and must have misplaced it somewhere.
I was curious to see how the Kindle version was, due to things like formatting issues that sometimes occur.
Disappointingly, the free sample is only the forward.
Not even one page of the book.
The price is not bad in comparison to some Kindle editions, but the sample definitely didn't let me check out the book at all.

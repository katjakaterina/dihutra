great addition to your purse
Love the Great point light pocket magnifier!
works great, especially if you forget your glasses and can't read the menu when you are out for dinner.... the light is a bonus in a dark restaurant, too.
I would have given 5 stars if it came with a case that covers the glass.
The clear plastic case it comes in is a little tacky and I'd be willing to pay a little more for a nice case to protec the lens.

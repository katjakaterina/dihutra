Useless trap, horrible design
The coons steal the bait from this trap at will.
I've had to re-engineer the trigger to even trip as a bowling ball rolled into it wouldn't engage the trip at first.
They advise putting bait past trip plate, but the coons just reach through the mesh and get the bait, another serious design flaw.
There are traps that work, this just in NOT one of those.
Save your money!

UGHHHH!!!
The game doesn't save at all and that's really irritating because you can't turn your computer off without it completely deleting your progress.
Also it turns on and off randomly so when you exit the game all of a sudden it pops back up again.
My six year old  thinks it's fun but he gets frustrated with it.

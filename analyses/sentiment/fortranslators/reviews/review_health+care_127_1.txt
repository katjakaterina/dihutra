Worked great for about 5 charges
I used NiCD batteries for a time years ago and gave up on those.
When I tried the NiMH batteries I started with these ones and was very disappointed with the technology, we used it in a mouse that required about twice a week changes, later I changed to Sanyo's eneloop and I'm very happy.

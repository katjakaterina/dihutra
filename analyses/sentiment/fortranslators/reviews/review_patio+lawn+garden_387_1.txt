Two different ones broke
The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick, and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.
As a result, it broke on the second day.
Amazon replaced with another, which broke due to same issue, but this time was too late to return.
I bought another, more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner

Band Discoloration
As most exercise products, these were used a few times, and stored away in the bag for a few months.
I took them out to start using them again after a car accident has kept me off the free weights, and the bands are starting to discolor and fade.
Makes me nervous that the integrity of the rubber is weakening...

most embarrassing gift
Because when the person this was gifted to opened it there wasn't a brush was not on the eyeliner.and I was looked at like what a cheap gift!
!And was asked if it was a knockoff and then read the one review that was left.
Hoping to get it replaced or refunded.Very unhappy customer

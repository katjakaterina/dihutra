Show me the money!
Interesting Grisham tale of a lawyer that takes millions of dollars from his firm after faking his own death.
Grisham usually is able to hook his readers early and ,in this case, doesn't play his hand to soon.
The usually reliable Frank Mueller makes this story even an even better bet on Audiobook.

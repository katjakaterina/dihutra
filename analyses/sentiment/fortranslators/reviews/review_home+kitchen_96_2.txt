Okay but you can figure it out yourself without the book
I bought this when I bought the pop maker.
I think the recipes are fine, but there really isn't much in the book I wouldn't have figured out myself.A couple of good creamy recipes that are now available for free on recipe websites.
As for "pop embellishing" well, that wasn't too hard to figure out, either.
I'd save the money and spend it instead on extra pop sticks, which seem to disappear the way socks do....

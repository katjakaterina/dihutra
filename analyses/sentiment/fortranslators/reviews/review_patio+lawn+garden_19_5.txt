Gilmour 8-ply Flexogen Hose 25 Foot
This little hose was purchased to add on to my other 50 foot hose due to the very humid and oppressive weather this last month in the Northeast.
It is very flexible and easy to handle and allows me total reach of the back perennial garden.
i would recommend this hose

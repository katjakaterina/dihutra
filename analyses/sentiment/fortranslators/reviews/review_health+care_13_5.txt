Just what I was looking for
This magnifier is just what I was looking for.
It is small and easy to hold.
I wanted something to read small numbers/characters on electronic stuff like computers, electronics, etc.
I also work on the insides of computers and this is great for seeing small things.
I don't want to magnify books or magazines.
The light works well and makes reading small things very easy.

Paddington publishers feared readers wouldn't relate to a talking bear, new letter reveals
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put oneself in the shoes of somebody reading it for the first time before it was published.
It's very amusing knowing now what we know about Paddington's huge success."
Saying her father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write the children's book by a small toy bear, would have been sanguine about his work being rejected, she added the 60th anniversary of the books publication was "bittersweet" after his death last year.
Of Paddington, whom she describes as a "very important member of our family," she added her father was quietly proud of his eventual success.
"He was quite a quiet man, and he wasn't a boastful person," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like if you have a child who achieves something: you're proud of them even though it's not your doing really.
I think he viewed Paddington's success sort of in that way.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always used to give the credit to Paddington himself."

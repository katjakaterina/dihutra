If you're looking for a tiny printed novelty you'll love this
I've always loved The Prophet and I've read it many times.
I gave away my last copy and was looking for a replacement.
I purchased this copy only to find that it was a tiny novelty version of the book.
If you're looking for something tiny to keep in your purse then this is for you.
If you're looking for a "real book" then this is a joke.

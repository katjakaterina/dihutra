Not for bushes
I have a large piece of property in Arizona that requires the removal of bushes from time to time and I figured this looked like the perfect tool to cut the main trunk/branches of a dessert bush; NOT!!!!
!It was worth a try, but it is clumsy and will not cut through most of the fibrous shoots of a typical desert bush.
I am back to the pick and spade.I have many tools for tree limbs that do a much better job than this.I'll give it to my brother.
:>)Note: My rating is strictly for the said application.

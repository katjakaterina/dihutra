Love the game
I want to start off by saying I have never played the Call of Duty games.
This is only the second first person shooter game that I have own.
I think it is a lot of fun.
Has good graphics and nice story line.
It does take some skill to get through the levels.
I think all players can enjoy this game.
There are three levels to choose from based on your skill level.
If your looking for first person shooter game that has current military type play than this is a good buy.

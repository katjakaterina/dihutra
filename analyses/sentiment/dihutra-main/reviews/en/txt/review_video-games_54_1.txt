Civil war Game
I don't know about the game because I can't play it.
I have widows vista and I can download the instructions, but error comes up when I try to play the game.
I contacted Ageod and they said I am the only one haveing trouble.
The internet says that Vista has a lot of game problems.
I just wasted my money on this game.

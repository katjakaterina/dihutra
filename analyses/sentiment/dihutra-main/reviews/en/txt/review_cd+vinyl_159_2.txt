Don't waste your money.
This isn't worth your money.
Doug runs through each song in about three or four minutes, he doesn't give you time to learn it.Unless you've already mastered transcribing (and then why buy this dvd?
), you're going to be left to rewinding a million times to get the right notes.This is no better than a youtube video of someone playing a bunch of clapton songs.Doug doesn't even show you the rhythm or other guitar parts!
You're left only knowing the lead!What sense does that make?

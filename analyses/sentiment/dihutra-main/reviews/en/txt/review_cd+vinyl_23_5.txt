Wonderful!!!
I had had a cassette of this recording, and knew I loved it.
I bought several of these CDs so that I could share with nephews, and friends, and keep one for myself.
Very gentle and easy to sleep to.
Words are clearly sung, understandable.
It's been a blessing to me that I was anxious to find and pass on to others.
Great for children-- I was a child when Grandma got me the tape.

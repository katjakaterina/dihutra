Nakedness not necessary!
The acting was good, the story was correct, but naked backsides was not necessary.
Also the Potiphers wife did not need to be so very seductive of a naked Joseph.
Not a Christian movie.
I felt that even though it was probably portrayed truthfully, Christans do not need to see so explicit a scene.
This should be rated PG 13 at least.

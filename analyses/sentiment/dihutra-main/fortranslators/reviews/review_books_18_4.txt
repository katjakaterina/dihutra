Dated but Valuable Reading
It is amazing that this book is nearly 15 years old, and further that Bill Gates was so spot on with the current technology that we see today.
It is a good read to see both the vision of this truly amazing entrepreneur, as well as to get an idea of how to think about technology enabling daily life.
Listen to what Bill gates says about the future of technology in your life - the past would indicate he knows what he's talking about.

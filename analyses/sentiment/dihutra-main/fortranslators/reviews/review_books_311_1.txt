Book in Shambles When Received
DO NOT BUY FROM THIS BOOK FROM Amazon.com LLC .
I ordered this book earlier in the week with Amazon Prime for a going away gift.
I received the book today.
The party is tomorrow.
Half of the book sleeve seems to have been cut off with an exacto knive, also leaving gashes in the book cover.
The packaging was fine.
I could return it but it wouldn't come back before tomorrow.
Spend extra and use another seller.

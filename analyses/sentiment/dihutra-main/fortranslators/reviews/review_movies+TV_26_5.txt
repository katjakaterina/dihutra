Fonzie as Scrooge
Henry Winkler is a fine actor and this version of the famous story is proof positive.
He does and excellent job as Ebeneezer Scrooge.
The story, of course, is the same as the other versions, but each remake brings a different interpretation by the actors and writers.
This one is fun and easy to watch.
A fine family film.

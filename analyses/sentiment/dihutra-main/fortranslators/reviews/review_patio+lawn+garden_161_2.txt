Not For Hills
I'm not sure how I missed that important point, but I did.
I don't see that clearly mentioned from scott's, either.
This particular model with the four wheels makes it nearly impossible to use on hills.
It just doesn't have the leverage to cut the grass.
So I'm back to the mower.
One thing I will say is that it cuts well on flat surfaces, but it does require a bit more effort than I thought to push.

Disturbing
I can honestly say that this is my least favorite holiday movie.
As a child I remember being very upset by the images of Aaron losing his parents, being kidnapped and almost losing his sheep BaaBaa.
The best part of this movie is Aaron playing for baby Jesus and regaining his trust in people again otherwise, make sure you have a box of tissues when viewing this movie.

One of my favorite Christmas movies!
Ignore some of the more negative reviews on here.
This made for TV movie really touches me every time I watch it; which is every Christmas.The acting is splendid and the story is well written.
It is suitable for the entire family and it gives a good picture of the depression era of our country.

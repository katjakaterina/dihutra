Not enough Matcha tea flavor for me ... (=_=)
I tried this for the first time today and it is delicious but I don't quite taste the Matcha flavor as you would in like say a Green Tea ice cream.
To me it tasted like white chocolate with a grainy texture which I'm guessing is the Matcha tea powder.
I think my favorite KitKat flavor mix is the Mocha.

love this!
Both sides are magnetic.
A real plus when you're entertaining more than one child.
The four-year old can find the letters for the words, while the two-year old can find the pictures the words spell.
(I bought letters and magnetic pictures to go with this board).
Both grandkids liked it a lot, which means I like it a lot as well.
Have not even introduced markers, as this will be used strictly as a magnetic board.

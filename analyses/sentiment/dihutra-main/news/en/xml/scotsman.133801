<seg id="1">Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic ahead of Rapid Vienna clash</seg>
<seg id="2">Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians, following the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.</seg>
<seg id="3">A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal but he believes Rangers can use that result as a springboard to greater things.</seg>
<seg id="4">"It was a good point for us because Villarreal are a good side," said the 31-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We went into the game believing we could get something and came away with a point.</seg>
<seg id="6">Maybe we could have nicked it in the end but, overall, a draw was probably a fair result.</seg>
<seg id="7">They were probably better in the first half and we came out in the second half and were the better side.</seg>
<seg id="8">Going into Thursday, it's another big European night.</seg>
<seg id="9">Hopefully, we can get three points but that will be tough game because they had a good result in their last game but, with the crowd behind us, I'm sure we can push on and get a positive result.</seg>
<seg id="10">Last year was definitely tough, between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes at the club itself but there's a feelgood factor about the place now.</seg>
<seg id="11">The squad's good and the boys are really enjoying it; the training's good.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hopefully, we can push on now, put last season behind us and be successful."</seg>

<seg id="1">Analyst lays out timeline of night woman was burned alive</seg>
<seg id="2">The prosecution rested its case Saturday in the retrial of a man who is accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="3">U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.</seg>
<seg id="4">He outlined for the jury how he used cellphone records to piece together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.</seg>
<seg id="5">Rowlett said he received location data from several cellphones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the evening of her death, contradicting his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported .</seg>
<seg id="6">When data showed his cellphone was with Chambers' during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.</seg>
<seg id="7">Sanford took the stand Saturday and testified that he wasn't in town that day.</seg>
<seg id="8">When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."</seg>
<seg id="9">Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.</seg>
<seg id="10">Cellphone records indicated they'd only known each other for a week.</seg>
<seg id="11">Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' texts, calls and contact information from his phone.</seg>
<seg id="12">"He erased her from his life," Hale said.</seg>
<seg id="13">The defense is scheduled to begin its closing arguments Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="14">The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.</seg>

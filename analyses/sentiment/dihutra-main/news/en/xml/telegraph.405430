<seg id="1">Paddington publishers feared readers wouldn't relate to a talking bear, new letter reveals</seg>
<seg id="2">Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put oneself in the shoes of somebody reading it for the first time before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="3">It's very amusing knowing now what we know about Paddington's huge success."</seg>
<seg id="4">Saying her father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write the children's book by a small toy bear, would have been sanguine about his work being rejected, she added the 60th anniversary of the books publication was "bittersweet" after his death last year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Of Paddington, whom she describes as a "very important member of our family," she added her father was quietly proud of his eventual success.</seg>
<seg id="6">"He was quite a quiet man, and he wasn't a boastful person," she said.</seg>
<seg id="7">"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like if you have a child who achieves something: you're proud of them even though it's not your doing really.</seg>
<seg id="8">I think he viewed Paddington's success sort of in that way.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always used to give the credit to Paddington himself."</seg>

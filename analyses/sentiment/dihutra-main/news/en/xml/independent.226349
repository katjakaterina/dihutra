<seg id="1">Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closes in on world title after team orders hand him win over Sebastian Vettel</seg>
<seg id="2">It became clear from the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes" team orders would play a large part in the race.</seg>
<seg id="3">From pole, Bottas got a good start and almost hung Hamilton out to dry as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.</seg>
<seg id="4">Vettel went into the pits first and left Hamilton to run into the traffic at the tail of the pack, something which should have been decisive.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Mercedes pitted a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after some wheel-to-wheel action that saw the Ferrari driver reluctantly leave the inside free at risk of holding out after a double-move to defend on the third corner.</seg>
<seg id="6">Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was in seventh by the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.</seg>
<seg id="7">He then led for a large part of the race as he held onto his tyres to target a quick finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth.</seg>
<seg id="8">He eventually came into the pits on the 44th lap but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen took fourth.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's a difficult day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman told let me by.</seg>
<seg id="10">The team have done such an exceptional job to have a one two," said Hamilton.</seg>

<seg id="2">Voters will vote Sunday on whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia."</seg>
<seg id="3">The popular vote was set up in a bid to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.</seg>
<seg id="4">Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbor's name represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly objected to its membership bids for the EU and NATO.</seg>
<seg id="5">Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite on the name change, has said he will disregard the vote.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to pay to join the EU and NATO.</seg>

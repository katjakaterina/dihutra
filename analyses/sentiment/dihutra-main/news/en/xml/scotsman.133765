<seg id="2">Two late tries may have skewed the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt Ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderfully-entertaining Tennent's Premiership match of the day.</seg>
<seg id="3">They now top the table, the only unbeaten side of the ten.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the end, it was their superior defence, as much as their better chance-taking, which carried the home side and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be pleased.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We've been tested over our games this far, and we're still unbeaten, so I have to be happy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Credit to Ayr, they took their chances better than we did."</seg>
<seg id="7">Grant Anderson's 14th minute try, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in front, but, a yellow card for Scotland cap Rory Hughes, released for the game by Warriors, allowed Melrose to make numbers tell and Jason Baggot grabbed an unconverted try.</seg>
<seg id="8">Climo stretched the Ayr lead with a penalty, before, right on half-time, he scored then converted a solo try to make it 17-5 to Ayr at the break.</seg>
<seg id="9">But Melrose began the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try, converted by Baggot, reduced the leeway to five points.</seg>
<seg id="10">There was then a lengthy hold-up for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was stretchered off, and from the restart, Ayr surged further ahead through a Stafford McDowall try, converted by Climo.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ayr acting captain Blair Macpherson was then yellow-carded, and again, Melrose made the extra man pay with an unconverted Bruce Colvine try, at the end of a spell of fierce pressure.</seg>
<seg id="12">The home side came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson was yellow-carded for tackling Climo without the ball, from the penalty line-out, MacPherson touched down at the back of the advancing Ayr maul.</seg>
<seg id="13">Climo converted, as he did again almost from the restart, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's box kick and sent flanker Gregor Henry away for the home side's fifth try.</seg>

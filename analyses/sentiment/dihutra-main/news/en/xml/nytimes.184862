<seg id="1">Hundreds of Migrant Children Quietly Moved to a Tent Camp on the Texas Border</seg>
<seg id="2">The number of detained migrant children has spiked even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to place children with sponsors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and have feared jeopardizing their own ability to remain in the country by stepping forward to claim a child.</seg>
<seg id="4">The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.</seg>
<seg id="5">Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.</seg>
<seg id="6">The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have prior criminal records.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Close to 80 percent of the individuals that are either sponsors or household members of sponsors are here in the country illegally, and a large chunk of those are criminal aliens.</seg>
<seg id="8">So we are continuing to pursue those individuals," Mr. Albence said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Seeking to process the children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Many will appear via video conference call, rather than in person, to plead their case for legal status to an immigration judge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Those who are deemed ineligible for relief will be swiftly deported.</seg>
<seg id="12">The longer that children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="13">Advocates said those concerns are heightened at a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs that a child is struggling are more likely to be overlooked, because of its size.</seg>
<seg id="14">They added that moving children to the tent city without providing enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could compound trauma that many are already struggling with.</seg>

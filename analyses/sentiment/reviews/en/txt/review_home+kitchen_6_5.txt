One in a million
I've been on the search for the perfect wedding cake recipe for over ten years.
You can call it an obsession as I personally love the way wedding cake tastes and I'm not even married!
I bought this book as soon as it was published and the recipes are incredible - as well as the photos.
For anyone who bakes wedding cakes this is one recipe book worth the investment.

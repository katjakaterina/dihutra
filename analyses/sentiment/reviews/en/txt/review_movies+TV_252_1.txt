1960's Classic Comes To This?
Narration is OK but the story is weak and the songs are brilliantly unremarkable.
I cringed when I watched this with my son.
I admit I grew up with the original show with Jimmy Durante narrating and the title song a well written classic, rather than a lame paean to 1990's PC themes.
This is probably inevitable in that you unfortunately can't re-make something from that era with the same innocence and feel: not in an era where Christmas has become lifeless.
Oops!
I said Christmas, I meant Happy Holidays!

I'm not opposed to this resistance!
I worked out once back in '08.
I picked up some 40 lb weights and was like - &#34;too easy&#34;.
So then I grabbed some resistance bands and almost broke them.
Now I've been recommended Black Mountain products because they are very durable.
I've had a set of the 25 lb red resistance bands for 3 months now and they look as good as when I first got them after an hour of use every day except Sunday.

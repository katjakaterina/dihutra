Disappointing
The theory of 5 book is not a definitive publication.
It gives some easy guidelines and theories but does not delve deeper into proper technique.
The pictures are atrocious and are barely worth looking at.
I cannot recommend this volume to anyone but the most basic home pet owner.
Significantly overpriced for the offered content.

Lots of FUN!! Very CHEAP made!!!
We have this same game but it was made in 1967, we just thought the newer version would be more up with the times but we like the old one much better!!
This one the tiles are cardboard and the little stand to put your pieces on is also made of very cheap cardboard!!
We just gave this game a way and kept our old one!

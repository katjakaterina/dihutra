Waste of $
If you want your bird to interact with you, then interact with your bird.
Parrots have the mental capacity of a 3-5 year old child.
This is like plopping your child down in front of the TV and calling it quality time.
Parrots learn to communicate dynamically not by rote.
I have 5 parrots and all are chatty because we chat, while cleaning, cooking, doing laundry.. whatever.
Turn off the TV and read aloud, talk, sing, dance.. be one of the flock.

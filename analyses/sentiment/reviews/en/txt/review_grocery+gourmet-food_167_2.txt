Painful cramps with this......
Mother and I started drinking this back in the 1980's.
I stopped because it was causing me too much pain, slightly worse than menstrual cramps.
The herbs in this tea are strong.
I think I read somewhere where the Senna in this stimulates the bowels to contract.
This isn't really a weight loss product but more a laxative.

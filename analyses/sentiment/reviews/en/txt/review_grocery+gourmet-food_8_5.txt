So Delicious!!
Creamy white chocolate infused with Matcha green tea surrounding layers of wafers.
Much less sweeter than the traditional Kitkat.
Small size is perfect to satisfy the chocolate craving w/o the guilt.
Was in LA last week and picked up a bag on a whim at the Japanese store in Little Tokyo.
Now, back in WI and regretting not picking up a handful more.
Not only were these Kitkats delicious, the bags were only $5 each!

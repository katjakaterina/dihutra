Perfect!
I was worried about this order because the picture on the description page kept changing to a less-desireable green/orange cover.
But alas, it came a day earlier than expected, and the beautiful pink product expected!
The "rubberized" cover feels a little greasy (like it was armor-all'd), but the design is gorgeous and a little 3D looking!

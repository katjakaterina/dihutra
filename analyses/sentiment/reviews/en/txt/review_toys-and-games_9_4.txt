A must have for any homeschooling classroom !
This is good product to have with unlimited possibilities.
I also ordered the magnetic letters & numbers by Melissa & Doug.
The dry erase has to be erased quickly or they tend to leave marks.
Also, the magnet is not very strong.
It's a nice size & works very well for our needs.

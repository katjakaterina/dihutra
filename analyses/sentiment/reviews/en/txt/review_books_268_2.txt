We all know the text, but
this book is a small version of the original.
I ordered it and when I opened it I was very disappointed to find that it is not the industry standard that I knew.
Then I went back to see if I missed something about the size in the description, but could not find any reference to it.
On a positive note, Amazon's return policy is amazing.
Immediate Credit when informed of the problem and the return shipping was very easy.

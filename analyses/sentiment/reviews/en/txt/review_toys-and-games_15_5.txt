Every child should have this!
We had purchased Melissa & Doug magnets & had some made & went looking for a board.
THIS IS IT!
It is so reasonable and has been in use ever since we received it.
You can spell words, put the Leap Frog base on it to put in letters/animals, numbers, etc.
It is also double sided.
Even though it's not intended they also like to put things under/inside the board.
They can roll things through it.
Highly recommend & every child should have one to put their magnets on.

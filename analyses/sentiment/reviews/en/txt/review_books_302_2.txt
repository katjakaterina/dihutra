In the land of the blind...
This piece of literature promises enlightenment but fails to deliver.
Though the transient prophet indeed speaks eloquently and his words inspire deep reflection, they fail to impart true understanding.
The initial discourse on love is riveting but what follows quickly descends into empty rhetorical musings which continue until the bitter end.
The most entertaining aspect of this book is the artful use of language which almost masks the fact that the prophet indeed speaks but says nothing.

A Worthy Version of A Christmas Carol
This is Charles Dickens' classic Christmas Carol with an American twist.
This version does a nice job of capturing the consequences of history and one's personal role in it.
It provides a sobering view of the main character's choices, just as the original, &#34;A Christmas Carol,&#34; did but this version also shows how one man's choices affect those around him.
I recommend this film to anyone who collects different versions of, &#34;A Christmas Carol.&#34;

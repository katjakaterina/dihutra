Just as hoped
I was worried about getting a short one, but this serves my need just fine, as it accompanied by a longer and more troublesome one.
I leave the sprinkler on it instead of switching heads - so much easier.
slightly stiff to lay out, but if it weren't, I am sure it would kink.
I got it with the gilmore brass 2-way hose connector - an excellent pair for me

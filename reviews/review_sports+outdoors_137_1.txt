Missing parts, Cheaply made
My kit arrived with parts missing.
Everything was in disarray, with just a few parts resting in their spots.
After inspecting it and putting everything back where it belongs, I opted to send it back.
The parts feel chintzy and overall looks like a cheap  kit.
I didn't even try to use it...just packed it up and sent it back.
What a disappointment.

became a mess
Started out as a great road trip activity for my 5 yro  but after the 2 yro used it, it became a mess.
The stix became stuck together or had hairs stuck to them.
It doesn't come with a reusable bag or anything so they are all stuck in a big ball to the top of the book right now - neither my kids nor I want to deal with organizing them.

A Winner
This is the first battery case I have had for my Galaxy S4.
The S4 fits very well, is slim and doesn't add much weight to the Galaxy S4.
It doubles the battery life.
You can charge either the battery, the phone or both.
There is a handy on-off switch with leds to indicate the level of charge.The battery case came on time and was packaged well.
Well worth the price.

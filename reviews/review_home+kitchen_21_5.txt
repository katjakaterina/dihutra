Chocolate Butter Cake
I just multiplied the Chocolate Butter Cake recipe by five to get 30 cups and it turned out PERFECT!!
I spent too much time in the past throwing away batter or cakes because they tasted terrible but this one was the absolute best cake I have ever tried.
The batter tastes like chocolate pudding and the cake itself melts in your mouth.
I will definitely be trying all of the other recipes :)

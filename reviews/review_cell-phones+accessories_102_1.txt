FAIL
JUNK!!
!......This product must be miss labeled.
I can not get my Samsung S2 phone to charge with this OEM charger.
The lights are on, the phone says its charging but nothing happens.
I am not sure if I got a defective product but it is very upsetting to sit in your car for hours and not see your phone recharge.
If you need a reliable charger, DO NOT purchase this product.If you need a car charger for your Samsung S2, I would recommend the Motorola Vehicle Power Adapter.
It charges fast and is dependable.

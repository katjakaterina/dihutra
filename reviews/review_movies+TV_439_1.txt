Still NOT completely remastered
In the item notes for this DVD it claims it is remastered.
Though it is not as poor quality as the 2004 DVD, it still has black dots and white scratches in the picture.
Is CBS the only place you can find the completely remastered version?
This is NOT worth $14.99, more like $4.99.
Remaster the thing or don't supply it.
:(

Groomer in Training
I am currently training to be a Groomer/Pet Stylist and this is the book my company uses in their grooming academy to train all groomers.
It is wonderful.
It is very helpful to know that you can turn to any page in this book and find the breed of dog you are looking for.
There are also general instructions that apply to many breeds (ex: teddy bear heads, etc).
Directions are simple, yet detailed enough for anyone to understand.
A must have for groomers and pet stylists!

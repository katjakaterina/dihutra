Very handy, works well
I only gave this 4 stars instead of 5, because of the packaging it comes in.
The plastic is sharp & isn't that easy to carry in your bag without stabbing yourself on it, but without the plastic box, the magnifier would get very scratched.
I may discard the plastic box, but keep the magnifier in something soft, like a small sock.
Otherwise, the magnifier works great.

Great set.
I like it but I have to say I wish they included a way to &#34;loop&#34; the band over something to be able to do pull-down or back exercises.
I ended up using the &#34;ankle&#34; attachment to do that and works for me.
Quality is great and would definitely see this lasting me a long time.
I love the carabineer because you can use 2 or more at the same time with the handles once you get stronger.

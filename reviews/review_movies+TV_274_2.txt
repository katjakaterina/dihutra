NOT REMASTERED!  How can they even claim this?
Wonderful ,program, heartwarming story, and the sh?^[EST PRESENTATION YET..
This dvd is not restored...one...sengle.bit.
It is the same dark, muddled, dirty, bespeckled and trimmed copy we've seen on tv , video, and dvd, for what?
forty years?
I was taken in, amazed and ecstatic that my favorite holiday special would now look as wonderful as it deserved to.
I'm tempted to take it back, but at least it's on a stand-alone dvd, instead of added as an afterthought to some Rankin-Bass collection of more &#34;famous&#34; specials.

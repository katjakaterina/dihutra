Works as well as the factory tool
I had a factory Glock tool that I was using for my Glock 26, 27, and 17.
I've since lost it and had needed another.
Since I've used Ghost products prior, and know that they are reliable, I had decided to order this one.
Sure enough, this is just as good as a factory tool.

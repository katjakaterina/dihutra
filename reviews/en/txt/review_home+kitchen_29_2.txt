martha stewart's wedding cakes
I have bought a lot of cake decorating books but if you are looking for a guide to decorating cakes I thouroughly recommend buying a collette peteres or peggy porschen.
Even though this book has a lot of  photo's it provides some information not much and honestly for the price I would prefer to buy a wedding cake magazine.
This book was a dissapointment not very helpful or useful really.

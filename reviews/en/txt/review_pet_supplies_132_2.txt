Waste of money.
This is the same DVD series someone had given me back in 2007 and it stinks.
The camera moves too much, jerking around and I could have made a better video using my cell phone.
Only one of the 3 videos is remotely interesting to my cat, the same video she liked back in 2007 but after 10 min., she too is bored.
I cannot watch it, it makes me dizzy.

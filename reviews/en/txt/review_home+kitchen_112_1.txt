Not for use with silverware
We received these salad plates and bowls from our wedding registry.
They are absolutely beautiful BUT NOT FUNCTIONAL.
It seems that they are meant to be used only with wooden utensils or chop sticks because any metal utensil used on the surface leaves a gray mark and makes an awful noise that is completely unbearable!
Enough that we have to purchase new dinner ware.
I really wish this was not the case because I love the design, just be aware before you buy!

Not the original stories
I must agree with the other reviewers that this set is awful as it does no show the episodes in the original clifhanger form as shown on TV.
I will be the first in line to buy underdog when it is produced as it was ORIGINALLY shown with all the shorts like tennessee tuxedo and commander mcbragg and with the cliffhangers.
Come on guys give us the original show as it should be and this set will fly off the shelves.
Until then you can keep this junk.

Book is not about sewing circles, but about putting circles on a quilt by applique
I was hoping for tips on how to sew circles.
This book is all about attaching circles to the quilt with fusible webbing and using raw edge applique.
Not even any tips on applique.
The good news is that the book is only 35 pages and didn't waste too much of my time.

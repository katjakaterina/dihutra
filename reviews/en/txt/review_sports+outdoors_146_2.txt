spend the extra money on a better kit
used it for a year or so and definitely have had to buy better equipment.
the skinny cleaning rod- snapped.. the thicker cleaning rod- also snapped.
i'm not one to apply heavy force on these, they're just very soft/cheap.
the brushes are decent enough.
after spending cash on a nicer kit, i guess i learned my lesson.
if you have the funds skip and buy something a little nicer.

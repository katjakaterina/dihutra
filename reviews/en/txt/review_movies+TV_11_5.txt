Outstanding Concept, and Performances
The small historic Canadian town of Elora, with its many century-old buildings, is the perfect setting for this story, set in the early 1900's.
Bringing the story to 20th century America allows the story to incorporate situations Americans can more easily with.
Henry Winkler does a great job of recreating the Scrooge character, and the supporting cast are no less admirable.
This is an annual &#34;must watch&#34; story for me.

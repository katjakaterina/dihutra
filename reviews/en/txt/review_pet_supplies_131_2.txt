DVD for Cats
Purchased this cat DVD for our active cat.
Hoping that it would keep his attention long enough to give me a break from playing with him.
I have to say that the first DVD is the only one that captures his attention for about 10-20 minutes.
The other DVD's he doesn't even look at.
Maybe I just have a cat that is just too active to sit still...I don't know.
I would recommend the first DVD only if you are thinking of trying it.
Great price and fast delivery.

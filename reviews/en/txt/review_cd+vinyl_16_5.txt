Fave!
I bought this in LP form when it was brand new, recorded it onto a cassette so I could play it in my car, listened, and listened, and listened.
I have so missed listening to this (no longer have a turn-table) that I've finally reordered it on CD.
YAY!!
Can't wait to play it, and play it, and play it.
No one, absolutely no one wears his heart for God on his sleeve like Keith Green!
I can't wait to meet him in heaven.

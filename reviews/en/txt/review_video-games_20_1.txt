Hurts my ears.
Came across this accidentally and took it home to play--thought it might be a good gift for a seven year old I know.
Games are fun, so far as I could stand the decibel level.
For me to hear the voices, the music was so loud that the total sound hurt my ears.
If the relative loudness of the music and voices were reversed, this would be a better product.

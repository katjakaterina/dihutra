Thank goodness they are expensive
Yes - this is one of the most expensive candies around, because it only comes imported.
But my goodness - are these ever good.
The KitKat folks could really clean up if they started selling these in the US.
Once you try them you can't wait for more.
So yummy and delivered quickly and fresh.

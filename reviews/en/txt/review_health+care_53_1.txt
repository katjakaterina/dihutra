If your package is orange & black, then send it back.
ONE STAR:The Maxell LR44 10-pack photo shows the new hologram packaging, but I received the old orange & black packaging.The batteries are stale.
Lights powered by them are semi-bright, and only last a day or so.The orange & black pack rates 1-star.FIVE STARS:From the same supplier, MyBatterySupplier, I ordered the50-pack, which did come in the new hologram package, and the difference was dramatic.
Lights powered by the batteries were brilliant, and I expect them to last much longer.The new hologram pack rates 5-stars.

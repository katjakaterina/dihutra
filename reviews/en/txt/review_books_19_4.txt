Logical follow-up to Tailchaser's Song
This work bears deep connections to themes first explored in Tad Williams' original breakout novel, about a brave young cat who travels to an underground netherworld to face an ancient evil.
As the owner of two cats myself, after the second read-through, I realized that this novel has much to teach about the critical importance of dealing with fur and dust.I could only give four stars, though, because the cats do not agree, and indeed wish I had not made this purchase.

These are my favorite candies ever!
After hearing mixed opinions about these Kit Kats, I decided to try them.
They are excellent, and I do not regret purchasing them at all.
They taste like matcha with a bit of a vanilla and milky flavor as well.
They are not too sweet or too plain.
These are the best Kit Kats I've ever had, and I would recommend them to anyone who likes matcha-flavored candies or anyone wanting to try an unusual kind of Kit Kat.

Boo! Dead batteries!
I just gave up and threw out these batteries, after only a couple of months.
I had them in rotation (with two other sets of rechargeables-- Duracell and Sanyo) in my digital camera.
In the beginning, they were fine and comparable to the other brands.
Now they don't even last one day in my camera.
Sometimes I get only a handful of pictures in before they die.
I don't have that kind of patience...
I won't buy Energizer rechargeables again.

Solid Charger but RF noisy
This is a nice charger but you can tell it was made cheaply in China.
When it is charging the phone, the car radio gets LOTS of static.
Not so much that I have to stop charging but like when you are near power lines and the radio station is far away.So, no RF shielding.I gave it 4 stars because it works fine for me, but if you listen to the radio, you might consider it is more like 2 or 3 stars.

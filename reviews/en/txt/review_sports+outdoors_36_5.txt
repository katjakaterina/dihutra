Quick and easy and economical
This was a great surprise for the money.
I looked at resistance band workouts on YouTube and decided to try it out.
At this price why not?
I really feel like I had a good workout after my first try.
The door anchor worked great.
I'm 71 and keeping big equipment around the house is just not possible.
This I just keep in my night stand and any time I've got some extra minutes I do a little workout.
Pleasantly surprised and pleased.
I highly recommend.

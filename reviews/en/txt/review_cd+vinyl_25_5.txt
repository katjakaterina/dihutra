Memories
My mother-in-law bought this video for my daughter when she was young.
I was looking for videos the other day for my three year old granddaughter and came across this.
My granddaughter LOVES this video.
She watches it OVER and OVER and OVER.
It is older, dated and corny, but she loves it!
We even find ourselves singing the songs!

His last album is focused on Praise
Keith Green / Songs for the Shepherd:  His previous albums were more focused on encouragement and correction towards the Church.
This, his last, is focused on Praise.
This one is still not as great as his first album, but it is a strong enough Praise album to earn Five Stars.

The worst kit out there
I bought this from Walmart for the same price as Amazon.
On my first use, the cleaning rod broke at the extension point and the plastic handle came off on the other one.
I will never buy anything with Outers written on it.
I am buying individual parts from Tipton and other reputable manufacturers to make my own cleaning kit.

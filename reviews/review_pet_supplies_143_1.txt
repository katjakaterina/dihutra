Not worth it.
When I bought this combo, it was more expensive than the 3 DVDs bought separately.
Unfortunately, I saw it too late.
My bad.
But where's the logic ?Then my cats didn't like those DVDs.
Well, more like "not interested" than "don't like".
TV off or Cat Sitter is the same.And really those DVDs are cheap.
Always the same videos, the same animals, the same noises.
I mean, what's the point of hearing birds if we are seeing fish ??
?I was more entertained by those DVDs than my cats.

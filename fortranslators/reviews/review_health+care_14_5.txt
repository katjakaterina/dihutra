COLORFUL, lighted, pocket magnifier-easy to find in a black purse!
Most of the purses I own have black lining.
Good luck finding anything black in black purse!
I chose this color because I can actually find it!!!
It works wonderfully in a dimly lit restaurant, when the print is really small, when I need a light & a magnifier to find the splinter.
WONDERFUL.

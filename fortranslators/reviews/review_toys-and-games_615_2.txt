I hate that these are so expensive
My Grandson got this and because of the movie, he got this one, but all my Great Grands got one cheaper and IMHO better because the arms and legs were wire and extremely posable.
However, my Grandson (9 yrs old) loved this elf and his Momand Dad had fun using the concept during the Holidays.

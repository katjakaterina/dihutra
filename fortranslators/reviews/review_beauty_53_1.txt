Another Fake MAC on here, dont buy!
Why should you care?
Sales of fake MAC pigments are widespread across the Internet, so people often assume they must be safe or even identical to genuine MAC products.
Unfortunately, that is not the case.
Fake MAC pigments have been analyzed to contain chemical irritants, bacterial contamination (including in at least one case e. coli) or even toxins like lead and carcinogens.
Do you really want to risk blindness or permanent facial scarring just to get a deal?

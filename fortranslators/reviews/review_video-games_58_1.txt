Misleading
Nowhere in the description does it tell you that it won't run on any program newer than Windows 98.
I built a gaming computer that would have cost over $3K if you could buy anything close to it in a retail environment so I know it isn't my machine.
VERY disappointed as I am a very big Douglas Adams fan.

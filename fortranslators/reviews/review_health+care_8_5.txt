Excellent Design and Functionaality
We bought one for road trips and trying to interpret maps without having to strain our eyes.
Really nice design, good tactile feel.
I couldn't figure out where the batteries were, sent Lightwedge Customer Service an email and received a response within 24 hours.
If you need one I'd recommend this one.

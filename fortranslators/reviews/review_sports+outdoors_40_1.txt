Broke extrememly fast, inconvenient.
The red band(heaviest resistance) started tearing the first time I used it, so for obvious reason I stopped and tried the black one.
The black one lasted fine for the exercise, but the next day it started ripping in the same place as the red one.
I will not use the other colors as they simply do not have enough resistance.
A big minus is that this set has only one pair of handles and to switch from one handle to another is a big inconvenience and a waist of time.

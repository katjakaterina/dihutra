Clapton Classics
Very disappointing.
This was advertised to be a "note-for-note" lesson on selected Clapton tunes, and it was not even close.
There was no tab to support the little (and sometime inaccurate) portions of the songs that were listed.
I sent a complaint directly to Hal Leonard, but never received the courtesy of a reply.

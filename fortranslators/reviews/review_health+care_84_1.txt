Expensive junk
I bought a pack of these a while back from Sam's Club.
I used them in my appliance remotes but noticed that they don't hold their charges for long thereby necessitating frequent recharges.
The cheap rapid charger 'CH30MN' that came with the battery pack did not help matters either as it heats the batteries up during the charging process to the point of being unbearable to touch.Save your money and buy the newSANYO NEW 1500 eneloop 8 Pack AA Ni-MH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteriesinstead.

Hated this product.Predictable.
Not fun.
It attempts to be a fast setup table top game but feels as a meshed together mess of crap.
Often times I thought &#34;this seems like d&d; battle....  Just kidding&#34;.
We never played it again after one play through.Would not recommend this for an older gaming group that enjoys board/card ga,es like talisman and 7 wonders and ascension.F

Great art -- framing problem
Paid extra to get the framed version of this artwork for my son's room.
Love the cartoon itself.
But was disappointed that the matting of the frame was a different color from what was depicted in the item's photo.
I sent an email to the company (Andrews McMeel Art) about a week ago and so far they haven't responded.Update -- the company has responded to my email with a very nice note that indicates they'll make things right.
I may end up a completely satisfied customer after I'll.
If so, I'll update again.

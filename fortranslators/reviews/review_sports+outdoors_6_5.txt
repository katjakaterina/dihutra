Glock punch tool - needed for your Glock and other applications too
Needed this tool to really break down my G22, and it works perfectly for that.
No difference from OEM I suspect.However, had an added bonus when realizing that I needed a punch to properly disassemble the bolt carrier in my AR for a thorough cleaning, and this tool worked perfectly to push the carrier's retaining pin out and then back into place after the job was completed.
Excellent!
It is now in my range bag for safe keeping.

A few good tips, but that's about it
If you actually want to make and decorate a cake, this book isn't much use.
The book is mainly composed of images of wedding cakes, most of which weren't remotely close to something I would consider.
Even if they had been something I liked, only a handful of them included instructions, which means I wouldn't have been able to make most of them anyway.
The book did have a few good tips and a few cake and icing recipes.

Complete waste of time and money.......
This game would not install on any of my seven computers.
The installer is so dated that if it detects any hardware that it doesn't recognize (i.e.
modern hardware), it aborts.
Tried all the user forum tricks I could find.
None of them helped.
Even the publisher has abandoned this game and no longer supports it.
Complete waste.
Needless to say, my son was very dissappointed.
Don't bother with this one.
It's deprecated software meant for deprecated hardware.

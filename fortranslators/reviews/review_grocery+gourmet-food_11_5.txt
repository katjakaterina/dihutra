Amazing!
I ordered these in Summer so they of course arrived melted, a trip the freezer made them awesome again though.
Just order them in cooler times of the year and you should get them in good condition.I love these so much more than the regular chocolate Kit-Kat bars.
I hope some day to see them on store shelves in the US some day.

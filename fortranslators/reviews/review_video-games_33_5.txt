Great game still!
I had this game as a kid in the 90s and played it religiously with my sisters around our Windows 95 PC.
I recently bought it for my cousin's 6th birthday because I want her to build better computer and problem solving skills.
Computers and games have definitely evolved since then, but this is timeless game that helps kids develop those skills in a fun way without math equations and spelling.
Watching her play brought back really fond memories and made me want to play again.
&#34;Whoever you are.... MAKE ME A PIZZA!&#34;

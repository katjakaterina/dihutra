Only 3 years, instead of 5 as promised
These were described as guaranteed for 5 years, but have an expiration date that is only 3 years (Mar 2016).
Since I am using them for battery back-up in clocks this is a real bummer.
Not what I expect from Amazon.
Will probably live with it rather than mess with a return.

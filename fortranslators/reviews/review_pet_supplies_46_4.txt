An AWESOME reference guide for any groomer
This is perhaps the best and most thourough book available for dog grooming.
As a professional groomer, I reference it often!
My only complaint is the spiral binding.
Perhaps because I use it so much..it has come loose and the pages are falling out.
That may be a testament to how good this book truly is!

Great flavor
I've purchased different curries in the grocery store and was never completely happy with the flavor.
I read a recipe that recommended this brand and after using it I can see why they recommend this specific brand.
Great flavor - I purchased all 3 - Green, Red, and Yellow curry paste and have enjoyed all 3 types.

Had to return...
This pruner does not even remotely cut 1&#34; branches, wet or dry.
Does not cut 3/4&#34; branches.
It may cut SOME 1/2&#34; dry branches but at least the one I received was not sharpened and I was forced to return it.
Have not decided on a new one yet, since I was so disappointed after reading all the great feedbacks and finding different.

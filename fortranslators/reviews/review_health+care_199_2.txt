Older batteries came out in a plastic case.
Item did not arrive on a cardboard card, it arrived in an easy to open plastic case and with the expiration date only 3 years out.
Fresh batteries have a 5 year expiration date.
The description and the picture of this item needs to be changed if they are going to sell Amazon customers a different and older item.
They were nice and sent me a return label free of charge.

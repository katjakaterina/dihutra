creepy elf - extras is like investing in skylanders or disney xfinity
Here's a creepy little elf and a book.
If you want the elf to cook and buy all the accessories its like buying skylanders or Disney xfinity.
Every little extra thing costs at least 20.00.
This is awful quality too.
I would not recommend thistle anyone.
Save your money and buy a nice advent calendar instead - I suggest a LEGO advent calendar!

Great sauce....if you have nothing else.
Low quality and low flavor hot sauce....not all that hot either.If you need some hot sauce and have nothing else around, then this will do, but that there are so many other choices, this is the worst choice to make.
Even regular tobasco sauce is much much better.I can only describe it as being similar to watery taco bell sauce.I would recommend Frontera Hot Sauce, Tobasco, or Cholula Hot sauce over this.

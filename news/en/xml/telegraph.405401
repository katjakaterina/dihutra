<seg id="1">Parliament's statue of Cromwell becomes latest memorial hit by 'rewriting history' row</seg>
<seg id="2">Its banishment would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artefacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.</seg>
<seg id="3">But the Cromwell Society described Mr Crick's suggestion as "folly" and "attempting to rewrite history."</seg>
<seg id="4">John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the present debate about the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.</seg>
<seg id="5">The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.</seg>
<seg id="6">Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.</seg>
<seg id="7">Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell is evidence of 19th century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure who many believe is still worth celebrating.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whether that is a wholly accurate representation is the subject of continuing historical debate.</seg>
<seg id="10">What is certain is that the conflict of the mid 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual recognisable figure who represents one side of that divide.</seg>
<seg id="11">His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and commemorating."</seg>

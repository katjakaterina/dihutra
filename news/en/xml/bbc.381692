<seg id="1">Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross cleric celebrated</seg>
<seg id="2">The only Church of England cleric to win a Victoria Cross during World War One as a combatant has been celebrated in his hometown 100 years on.</seg>
<seg id="3">Lt Col The Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the highest British military honour.</seg>
<seg id="5">A commemorative stone was unveiled by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="6">One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years on from his grandfather's award-winning feat.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lt Col Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from field and machine guns."</seg>
<seg id="8">He later rushed up to the firing line and with the "greatest gallantry" led the line forward before rushing a field-gun single-handed and knocked out three of the detachment.</seg>
<seg id="9">Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just over a month before the war ended.</seg>
<seg id="10">Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something that I know that I could never live up to but something which is humbling."</seg>
<seg id="11">He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.</seg>
<seg id="12">Michael Vann said he was "feeling very honoured to play a part in the parade" and added "the valour of a genuine hero is being demonstrated by the support that is going to be given by a lot of people."</seg>

<seg id="1">18 states, D.C. support challenge to new asylum policy</seg>
<seg id="2">Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="3">Representatives from the 18 states and the district filed a friend-of-the-court brief Friday in Washington to support an asylum-seeker challenging the policy, NBC News reported.</seg>
<seg id="4">The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions suit that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the federal policy has not been revealed.</seg>
<seg id="5">She said her partner "and his violent gang member sons," abused her but U.S. officials denied her request for asylum July 20.</seg>
<seg id="6">She was detained in Texas.</seg>
<seg id="7">The states' attorneys supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of applicants for U.S. asylum, as nations facing pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.</seg>
<seg id="9">District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal, and international law."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Federal law requires that all asylum claims be adjudicated on the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a bar violates that principle," the friend-of-the court brief said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Attorneys further argued in the brief that the policy denying immigrants entry hurts the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "supply necessary labor."</seg>
<seg id="12">Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Asylum is available for those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear on account of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his June 11 announcement of the policy.</seg>
<seg id="14">Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems -- even all serious problems -- that people face every day all over the world.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court</seg>
<seg id="2">House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he was temperamentally unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="3">Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had ever performed that way, they would say 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="5">Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.</seg>
<seg id="6">During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times nearly shouting and choking up while discussing his family and his high school years.</seg>
<seg id="7">He also explicitly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a "grotesque and coordinated character assassination" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.</seg>
<seg id="8">Pelosi said that she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court, because it showed that he is biased against Democrats.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I think that he disqualifies himself with those statements and the manner in which he went after the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">Pelosi demurred when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he is confirmed, and if Democrats gain the majority in the House of Representatives.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I will say this -- if he is not telling the truth to Congress or to the FBI, then he's not fit not only to be on the Supreme Court, but to be on the court he's on right now," Pelosi said.</seg>
<seg id="12">Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.</seg>
<seg id="13">Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh rulings against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered to be a conservative justice.</seg>
<seg id="14">In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh sidestepped questions on whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It's not time for a hysterical, biased person to go to the court and expect us to say, 'isn't that wonderful,'" Pelosi said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Scherzer wants to play spoiler vs. Rockies</seg>
<seg id="2">With the Nationals eliminated from playoff contention, there wasn't much reason to force another start.</seg>
<seg id="3">But the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to take the mound on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, who hold a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Rockies clinched at least a wild-card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to lock up their first division title.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Even though we're playing for nothing, at least we can be able to toe the rubber knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team would be playing at probably the highest level of any point I would face this year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?"</seg>
<seg id="7">The Nationals have yet to announce a starter for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to let Scherzer pitch in such a situation.</seg>
<seg id="8">Scherzer, who would be making his 34th start, threw a bullpen session on Thursday and would be pitching on his normal rest Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.</seg>

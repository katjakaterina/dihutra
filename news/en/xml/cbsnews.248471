<seg id="1">Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds</seg>
<seg id="2">The FBI investigation into accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and raises the question of whether the bureau's findings could sway any Republican senators into pulling their support.</seg>
<seg id="3">In an interview airing Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republicans Sens. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could unearth anything that would lead them to change their minds.</seg>
<seg id="4">Kennedy appeared more open than his colleague from South Carolina.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I said going into the hearing, I said, I've talked to Judge Kavanaugh.</seg>
<seg id="7">I called him after this happened, that allegation came out, said, 'Did you do it?'</seg>
<seg id="8">He was resolute, determined, unequivocal."</seg>
<seg id="9">Graham's vote, however, appears set in stone.</seg>
<seg id="10">"My mind's made up about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a dynamite accusation," he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it vigorously," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.</seg>
<seg id="12">"And everybody she names couldn't verify it.</seg>
<seg id="13">It's 36 years old.</seg>
<seg id="14">I don't see anything new changing."</seg>

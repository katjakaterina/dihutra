<seg id="1">HIV/Aids: China reports 14% surge in new cases</seg>
<seg id="2">China has announced a 14% jump in the number of its citizens who are living with HIV and Aids.</seg>
<seg id="3">More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health officials say.</seg>
<seg id="4">About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.</seg>
<seg id="5">The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, marking a change from the past.</seg>
<seg id="6">Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="7">But the number of people contracting HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.</seg>
<seg id="8">Year-on-year, however, the number of those living with HIV and Aids in China has risen by 100,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="9">HIV transmission through sex is an acute issue in China's LGBT community.</seg>
<seg id="10">Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be rife.</seg>
<seg id="11">Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.</seg>
<seg id="12">Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since 2003, China's government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to tackle the issue.</seg>

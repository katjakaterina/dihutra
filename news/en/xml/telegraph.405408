<seg id="1">How the US-China trade war may be good for Beijing</seg>
<seg id="2">The opening salvos of the trade war between the US and China were deafening, and while the battle is far from over, a rift between the countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, experts say.</seg>
<seg id="3">Donald Trump, the US President, fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminium.</seg>
<seg id="4">The most significant escalation rolled in this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (Â£150 billion) worth of items, effectively taxing half of all goods coming into the US from China.</seg>
<seg id="5">Beijing has retaliated each time in kind, most recently slapping tariffs of five to ten per cent on $60 billion of American goods.</seg>
<seg id="6">China has pledged to match the US shot-for-shot, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to blink anytime soon.</seg>
<seg id="7">Getting Washington to back down means caving into demands, but publicly bowing to the US would be far too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, China's president.</seg>
<seg id="8">Still, experts say if Beijing can play its cards right, US trade war pressures could positively support China over the long term by lowering the inter-dependence of the two economies.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that start an economic tailspin in either country is actually a lot more dangerous than onlookers have acknowledged before," said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.</seg>

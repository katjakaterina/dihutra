<seg id="1">Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger Counter</seg>
<seg id="2">And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and COUNTING ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="3">Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger Counter.</seg>
<seg id="4">A mainstay of science ever since, the Geiger Counter became a pop culture mainstay as well, as in the 1950 movie "Bells of Coronado," starring those seemingly unlikely cowpoke scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:</seg>
<seg id="5">Man: "What in the world is that?"</seg>
<seg id="6">Rogers: "It's a Geiger Counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.</seg>
<seg id="7">When you put these earphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms given off by the radioactivity in the minerals."</seg>
<seg id="8">Evans: "Say, it sure is popping now!"</seg>
<seg id="9">"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days short of his 63rd birthday.</seg>
<seg id="10">But the invention that bears his name lives on.</seg>

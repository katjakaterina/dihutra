The project contains data of the corpus Dihutra (Differences in Human Translations) that have been collected within activities supported by EAMT (EAMT sponsorship 2021).

The data contains the English news (from WMT2020 and 2019) and Amazon review texts translated into Russiand and Croatian by two groups of translators: professionals and students. This means that the same source texts were translated into the two target languages and by the two translator groups. We additionally include German professional translations of news, that were available in the WMT dataset.

'news' contains the news data (sources and transations)

'reviews' contains the review data (sources and translations).

'metadata' contains a copy of consent form that was given to translators. 

'fortranslators' contains sources only - these are the texts that were sent to translators for the translation task.
